# HumTransDatasetWeb
This is the official repository of the source code of the [website](https://www.humming-collect.online/) for collecting the [HumTrans](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dadinghh2/HumTrans) dataset. You can simply use `python run.py` to start a local server to try this code. If you want to deploy on a remote server like Amazon Lightsail, you can slightly modify this code to meet your own need.
